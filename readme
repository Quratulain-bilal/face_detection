# Real-Time Face Detection Using OpenCV

This is a simple Python project that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV and the Haar Cascade classifier. It detects faces from your webcam feed and highlights them with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Detects faces in real-time using your webcam.
- Uses OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade model (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`).
- No need to manually download or manage the Haar Cascade file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `face_detection.py`).
2. Ensure you have OpenCV installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
A window will open showing your webcam feed. Detected faces will be highlighted with blue rectangles.
Press q to quit the program.
Code Explanation
The script uses OpenCV's CascadeClassifier to load the pre-trained Haar Cascade model for face detection.
The webcam feed is processed frame-by-frame, and detected faces are highlighted with rectangles.
The program exits when the user presses the q key.
Notes
This project is intended for educational purposes and basic face detection tasks.
For advanced face detection (e.g., with better accuracy), consider using deep learning-based models like MTCNN or Dlib.
